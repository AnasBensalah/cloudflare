# Cloudflare

It is a Ruby wrapper for the Cloudflare V4 API. It provides a light weight wrapper using `RestClient::Resource`. The wrapper functionality is limited to zones and DNS records at this time, *PRs welcome*.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/b4k3r/cloudflare.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/b4k3r/cloudflare)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

  gem 'cloudflare'

And then execute:

  $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

  $ gem install cloudflare

## Usage

Get all available zones:

  zones = connection.zones.all

Get a specific zone:

  zone = connection.zones.find_by_id("...")
  zone = connection.zones.find_by_name("example.com")

Get DNS records for a given zone:

  dns_records = zones.first.dns_records.all

Show some details of the DNS record:

  dns_record = records.first
  puts records.first.record[:name]
  puts records
